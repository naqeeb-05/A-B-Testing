# A/B Testing 

## Project Descrption:

In this project an A/B testing of a landing page is carried for e-commerce website. On one hand there was a control group in which the website visitors were shown the old landing page and on the other hand the treatment group were shown the new page. The number of users in both groups were similar. Finally for each user group  conversion was recorded (that is when a user decides to pay for the company's product). The null and alternative hypothesis were setup up, A/B test and regression were performed and results were comapred.

## Key Insights

• In A/B testing when we performed sample simulation we found that the old landing page had slight better conversion rate <br>
• When a similar analysis was perfomed using built-in function the z_score further strenghtened the idea that old landing page had better conversion rate <br>
• The regression approach revealed that users from Canada had 1.041 times lower conversion rates when compared to users from US. However, users from UK had 1.009 times higher conversion rates <br>
• Similarly the conversion rates for the treatment group from Canada is 1.07 times lower than the US. However, the conversion rate for treatment group from UK is 1.015 times greater than US.
